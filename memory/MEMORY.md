# Persistent Memory

> This file contains curated long-term facts, preferences, and context that persist across sessions.
> The AI reads this at the start of each session. You can edit this file directly.

## User Preferences

- (Add your preferences here)
- UI should evolve iteratively; allow framework-level changes now and do a dedicated polish pass later for final interface quality.
- Security should be seamless for regular users: default protections on, with confirmations only for high-risk actions.

## Key Facts

- (Add key facts about your work/projects)
- Primary product security differentiator: encrypted-at-rest credential storage and strict separation so AI does not directly access raw user credentials.

## Learned Behaviors

- Always check tools/manifest.md before creating new scripts
- Follow GOTCHA framework: Goals, Orchestration, Tools, Context, Hardprompts, Args
- Use gt for GitHub-related workflows instead of interacting directly with GitHub.

## Current Projects

- (List active projects)
- Post-stack roadmap item: implement security-first auth/data foundation (Supabase-compatible JWT path + future RLS enablement + secret isolation).

## Technical Context

- Framework: GOTCHA (6-layer agentic architecture)
